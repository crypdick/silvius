# Silvius

Silvius is an open source system for controlling Linux by voice.

## Quick start instructions

- Try `./run.sh -t` to test speech recognition (it will ask which mic to use).
- Use `./run.sh -e` to execute results on your local machine.
- If you are getting spurious recognitions, try `./run.sh -G` to see the level of sound that forms background noise, and filter it out with `./run.sh -e -g 100`.
